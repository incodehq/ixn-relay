= Interaction Relay
:toc:

This microservice is a companion to the link:http://platform.incode.org[Incode Platform]'s link:https://github.com/incodehq/incode-platform/tree/master/modules/spi/publishmq[publishmq] module, an implementation of Apache Isis' `PublisherService` SPI.
Its job is to relay link:http://isis.apache.org/schema/ixn/ixn.xsd[interaction] messages from the "outbox" of an link:https://isis.apache.org[Apache Isis] application to a target message broker:

* the "outbox" is the `OutboxEvent` table in the Apache Isis database

* the message broker is ActiveMQ, though the architecture is pluggable so other broker implementations could also be supported.

When messages have been successfully relayed, they are removed from the outbox.

It can be used in conjunction with the link:https://github.com/incodehq/ixn-relay[incodehq/ixn-subscriber] to publish messages from an Apache Isis application to an integration webapp (eg implemented using https://camel.apache.org[Apache Camel]), but without either the Apache Isis app nor the integration app having knowledge of the other.

== Design

The relay doesn't access the Apache Isis database directly, instead it uses the `OutboxClient` that is provided by the https://platform.incode.org[Incode Platform].
The Apache Isis app in turn uses the `OutboxEventService` component (also part of the https://platform.incode.org[Incode Platform]).

The diagram below sketches the main classes:

[plantuml]
----
hide empty members

component "ixn-relay" {
    package spi {
        interface Relay {
            handle()
        }
    }

    package relay-mq {

        class RelayMq implements Relay {
        }
    }

    package webapp {

        class PollingRoute {
        }
        class Dispatcher {
        }
        class OutboxClient <<incode platform>> {
        }
    }
}

component ActiveMQ {
}

component "Apache Isis\nApp" {
    class "OutboxEventService" <<incode platform>> {
    }
}

OutboxClient .l-> OutboxEventService : "http GET"

PollingRoute .d-> Dispatcher
Dispatcher -> "0..*" Relay
Dispatcher -d-> OutboxClient

RelayMq .r-> ActiveMQ : JMS send
----

The `PollingRoute` is responsible for kicking off the `Dispatcher` periodically, which uses the `OutboxClient` to check if there are any messages in the outbox.

If so, the `Dispatcher` loops over all available `Relay` implementations.

Finally, the `RelayMq` implementation posts the interaction to the specified ActiveMQ JMS queue.



== Configuration

This microservice has been implemented using Spring Boot, and so is configured using an `application.yaml` file:

[source.yaml]
----
logging:
  config: classpath:logback.xml

camel:
  springboot:
    main-run-controller: true

spring:
  activemq:
    broker-url: tcp://localhost:61616

app:
  relay-mq:
    queue-name:
      memberInteractionsQueue
  polling-period: 10s
  outbox-client:
    base: http://localhost:8080/restful/
    username: sven
    password: pass

  tracing:
    tracing-type: none
----

[NOTE]
====
If ApacheMQ broker is not running, then Camel will keep retrying.
That's because `camel.springboot.main-run-controller` is set to `true`.

== Local Testing

=== Prereqs : Message Broker

This image requires an instance of Apache ActiveMQ to be running.
The easiest way to do this is using the link:https://cloud.docker.com/u/incodehq/repository/docker/incodehq/activemq-mssqlserver/tags[incodehq/activemq-mssqlserver] Docker image.
Note, this will default to using an in-memory database, so it has no hard pre-reqs itself.

For example:

[source,bash]
----
export TAG=20191011.1912.master.880118bc

docker run -d -p61616:61616 -p8161:8161 incodehq/activemq-mssqlserver:$TAG
----

Then, log on using: link:http://localhost:8161[]

=== How to run the example

The configuration file above shows Camel configured to connect to a remote broker (`tcp://localhost:61616`).

To run, just use maven:

[source,bash]
----
mvn -pl webapp spring-boot:run
----


== Docker

A Docker image of this app is available at https://hub.docker.com/r/incodehq/ixn-relay[Docker hub].

To allow configuration to be easily externalized, the image expects a `/run/secrets` directory to exist, and switches to and then runs the application in that directory.
Spring Boot will then link:https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-external-config.html#boot-features-external-config-application-property-files[automatically pick up] that configuration and use it.

Typically therefore all that is required is to define an `application.yaml` or `application.properties` file as a secret.
If the secret filename has a prefix, as may be the case for Docker swarm namespacing, (eg `foo.bar.application.yaml`) then a symbolic link (eg `application.yaml`) will be automatically created to the secret filename.
